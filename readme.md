# Lucky Miner Support
If you're looking to unlock your Lucky Miner, you've come to the right fork. This version of Skot's ESP-Miner firmware, kept as close to the original as possible, is adapted to work with LV07/LV08 and potentially future LVXX miners.

# Lucky Miner Flashing

Using a CP2104 USB to TTL Flasher. The 6 pins are located near the esp32.

![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/Z6yPfGJS/Screenshot-2025-03-18-at-11-06-57-AM.jpg)

1. Hardware Connections:
	 - 	Connect GND on the CP2104 to GND on the LV08.
	 - 	Connect RX on the CP2104 to TX on the LV08.
	 - 	Connect TX on the CP2104 to RX on the LV08.

2. Entering Programming Mode:
   -	Power up the LV08.
	 - 	Short the GND and IO0 pins on the LV08.
	 - 	While keeping them shorted, press the reset button on the LV08.
	 - 	After pressing reset, remove the short between GND and IO0.

3. Flashing the Unlocked LV08 Factory Firmware with any of the following tools
	 - 	[Bitaxetool](https://github.com/bitaxeorg/ESP-Miner?tab=readme-ov-file#flashing) (bitaxetool --firmware ./esp-miner-factory-lvxx-vx.x.x-x.x.x.bin)
	 - 	[ESPTool](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/installation.html) (esptool.py --port PORT --baud 230400 write_flash 0x000000 ./esp-miner-factory-lvxx-vx.x.x-x.x.x.bin)
	 - 	[Web Adafruit ESPTool](https://adafruit.github.io/Adafruit_WebSerial_ESPTool/) (offset 0x000000)

# ESP-Miner
esp-miner is open source ESP32 firmware for the [Bitaxe](https://github.com/skot/bitaxe)

If you are looking for premade images to load on your Bitaxe, check out the [releases](https://github.com/bitaxeorg/ESP-Miner/releases) page. Maybe you want [instructions](https://github.com/bitaxeorg/ESP-Miner/blob/master/flashing.md) for loading factory images.

# Bitaxetool
We also have a command line python tool for flashing Bitaxe and updating the config called Bitaxetool 

**Bitaxetool Requires Python3.4 or later and pip**

Install bitaxetool from pip. pip is included with Python 3.4 but if you need to install it check <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>

```
pip install --upgrade bitaxetool
```
The bitaxetool includes all necessary library for flashing the binaries to the Bitaxe Hardware.

- Flash a "factory" image to a Bitaxe to reset to factory settings. Make sure to choose an image built for your hardware version (401) in this case:

```
bitaxetool --firmware ./esp-miner-factory-401-v2.4.2.bin
```
- Flash just the NVS config to a bitaxe:

```
bitaxetool --config ./config-401.cvs
```
- Flash both a factory image _and_ a config to your Bitaxe: note the settings in the config file will overwrite the config already baked into the factory image:

```
bitaxetool --config ./config-401.cvs --firmware ./esp-miner-factory-401-v2.4.2.bin
```

## AxeOS API
The esp-miner UI is called AxeOS and provides an API to expose actions and information.

For more details take a look at `main/http_server/http_server.c`.

Things that can be done are:
  
  - Get System Info
  - Get Swarm Info
  - Update Swarm
  - Swarm Options
  - System Restart Action
  - Update System Settings Action
  - System Options
  - Update OTA Firmware
  - Update OTA WWW
  - WebSocket

Some API examples in curl:
  ```bash
  # Get system information
  curl http://YOUR-BITAXE-IP/api/system/info
  ```
  ```bash
  # Get swarm information
  curl http://YOUR-BITAXE-IP/api/swarm/info
  ```
  ```bash
  # System restart action
  curl -X POST http://YOUR-BITAXE-IP/api/system/restart
  ```

## Administration

The firmware hosts a small web server on port 80 for administrative purposes. Once the Bitaxe device is connected to the local network, the admin web front end may be accessed via a web browser connected to the same network at `http://<IP>`, replacing `IP` with the LAN IP address of the Bitaxe device, or `http://bitaxe`, provided your network supports mDNS configuration.

### Recovery

In the event that the admin web front end is inaccessible, for example because of an unsuccessful firmware update (`www.bin`), a recovery page can be accessed at `http://<IP>/recovery`.

### Unlock Settings

In order to unlock the Input fields for ASIC Frequency and ASIC Core Voltage you need to append `?oc` to the end of the settings tab URL in your browser. Be aware that without additional cooling overclocking can overheat and/or damage your Bitaxe.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Install the ESP-IDF toolchain from https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/
- Install nodejs/npm from https://nodejs.org/en/download
- (Optional) Install the ESP-IDF extension for VSCode from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=espressif.esp-idf-extension

### Building

At the root of the repository, run:
```
idf.py build && ./merge_bin.sh ./esp-miner-merged.bin
```

Note: the merge_bin.sh script is a custom script that merges the bootloader, partition table, and the application binary into a single file.

Note: if using VSCode, you may have to configure the settings.json file to match your esp hardware version. For example, if your bitaxe has something other than an esp32-s3, you will need to change the version in the `.vscode/settings.json` file.

### Flashing

With the bitaxe connected to your computer via USB, run:

```
bitaxetool --config ./config-xxx.cvs --firmware ./esp-miner-merged.bin
```

where xxx is the config file for your hardware version. You can see the list of available config files in the root of the repository.

Note: if you are developing within a dev container, you will need to run the bitaxetool command from outside the container. Otherwise, you will get an error about the device not being found.
